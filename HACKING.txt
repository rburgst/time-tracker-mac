This file contains information for developing and testing Time Tracker.

== Prerequisites == 
* Rubygems
* gem install text-format
* gem install cucumber
* gem install rspec

== Release Packaging ==

1. Make sure the version number is updated:
    1a. Update CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION for "All Configurations" in the Project Info.

2. Update the ChangeLog.yml.


4. Build the Time Tracker.zip release file:
    4a. Run `rake build_release`.  This will create "build/Release/Time Tracker-$(CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION).zip".

5. If Sparkle or the release file configuration has been changed, test the auto-update system:
    5a. Install the previous version of Time Tracker.
    5b. Update and post appcast/timetracker-test.xml
    5c. Open ~/Library/Preferences/com.slooz.timetracker.plist and change
        SUFeedURL to the location of timetracker-test.xml  (If the URL contains
        spaces, replace them with "%20".)
    5d. Ensure that the old version of Time Tracker can update to the new version.
    5e. Ensure that the new version of Time Tracker can update to itself.

6. Run `rake appcast` to generate appcast/timetracker-$(CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION).html
   and update appcast/timetracker-stable.xml

7. Publish the release:
    7a. Run `rake upload`.  You will need to enter your google code username and your googlecode
        password which is found at http://code.google.com/hosting/settings
        This will upload Time Tracker-$(CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION).zip and 
        timetracker-$(CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION).html to
        http://time-tracker-mac.googlecode.com
    7b. Upload timetracker-stable.xml to http://www.avh4.net/appcast/

8. Update the website:
    8a. Update the homepage http://time-tracker-mac.googlecode.com
    8b. Make the new release the featured download http://time-tracker-mac.googlecode.com
    8c. Update iusethis.com
    8d. Update versiontracker.com

9. Tag the release with "v$(CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION)" and push the commit.

== Appcast updates with Sparkle ==

There is a dummy appcast which will alway contain a fake "update" for Time
Tracker.  To use this to test the Sparkle updating, edit Info.plist and change
"SUFeedURL" to point to "timetracker-test.xml" instead of
"timetracker-stable.xml"
